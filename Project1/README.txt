How to run my code (enee436_project1.m):

First, make sure your MATLAB path is on the right path such that the program can open the files 'data.mat' and 'pose.mat'. Once that is done, you may proceed

My MATLAB code is broken up into two main sections by each classification task.

Classification Task 1 is the first 300 lines (section 1), and Classification Task 2 is the remainder of the MATLAB code (lines 300+). 

To run a certain classification task, put your cursor on the desired section of the data (anywhere in the 300-line section) and click on the text. You are now in that section. Once that is done, click the "run section" button at the top of the page, in the "Editor" section.

If you would like to change any parameters such as the dimensions for PCA or LDA or k nearest neighbors:

For Classification Task 2:
	- PCA: m dimension variable can be found on line 63
	- LDA: N/A
	- k: k nearest variable can be found on line 204

For Classification Task 1:
	- PCA: m dimension variable can be found on line 314
	- MDA: n dimension variable can be found on line 391
	- k: k nearest variable can be found on line 481
