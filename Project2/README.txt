How to Run the Code for both Task 1 and Task 2:

Take the .ipynb file and open it with Google Colaboratory. Once it is opened, click the green triangle button next to each window, and run each code fragment sequentially. When running fit() for task 1, this will take some time. 

For Task 1: once it is done, continue through, and your output will be shown in percentage accuracy for classification of each number. 

For Task 2: once it is done, at the end of the Training Loop and testing results, it will be in the window right below it (showing training accuracy and test accuracy).
